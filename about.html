    <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        Started in Chicago in the early 2010s; Butchered has gone through a few changes over the years to develop the sound the currently possess. Their brand of effects driven punk mix their influences and midwest sensibilities. Having toured across the midwest they've developed a flair for putting on a show where ever they end up. Looking to release a new album in mid 2019, they won't let anything stand in their way.
